2. Risk of Rain 2

There are also a few tools which are optional but allow you to do more advanced work beyond Stage creation

* Some free IDEs are
	* Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition
	* Visual Studio Code

### Git

* Git can also be used to download a copy of Rain of Stages

### uTinyRipper
uTinyRipper can be used to extract Risk of Rain 2, or other Unity Game, assets such as Textures, Sounds, and Models.

When working with Rain of Stages, it is recommended to make a copy of your Risk of Rain 2 folder to use. Rain of Stages provides facilities to modify your Risk of Rain 2 installation to ease debugging and testing of custom scripts and content. In some circumstances this setup could corrupt your Risk of Rain 2 installation, requiring you to re-install your copy. Using a copy for Rain of Stages will prevent long downloads in this occurrence.

To use this project you will need a copy of Unity that matches Risk of Rain 2's current unity version. As of this writing, that is Unity 2018.4.20f1.
