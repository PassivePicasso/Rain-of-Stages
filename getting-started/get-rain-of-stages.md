# Setting up Rain of Stages

After you've acquired the appropriate tools for developing content with Rain of Stages, you will need to install and configure Rain of Stages.

Rain of Stages attempts to conduct as many configuration steps as possible automatically. No configuration files necessary!

The first step is to download a copy of the Rain of Stages project, this can be done a few ways.

[Clone with Visual Studio](git-client://clone?repo=https://github.com/PassivePicasso/Rain-of-Stages){: .btn }
  * You must have a copy Of Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition or greater and GitHub for Visual Studio installed for this link to work.

[Clone with GitHub for Windows](github-windows://openRepo/https://github.com/PassivePicasso/Rain-of-Stages){: .btn }
  * I don't use GitHub for Windows, so please submit a PR to the gh-pages branch of Rain of Stages to provide instructions here.

[Download Zip](https://github.com/PassivePicasso/Rain-of-Stages/archive/master.zip){: .btn }
  * Extract this Zip into a folder anywhere on your computer and remember where you placed it.  We will open this later with Unity Hub.
