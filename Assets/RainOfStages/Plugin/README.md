Rain of Stages is a framework to assist in the creation, testing, packaging and deployment of custom Risk of Rain 2 stages and mods.

As a player you can install Rain of Stages and then additionally install any custom Stage mods to add custom stages to your stage list.
Custom Stages can include unique game mechanics and entirely new modes of play!

As a developer, Rain of Stages will allow you to develop custom stages, setup custom sets of monsters, monster family events, and interactables.
Additionally, you can write custom code which will allow you to introduce new mechanics to the game via the BepInEx Unity game patcher and plugin framework.

If you would like to get started making Stages visit the [Github Pages for Rain of Stages](https://passivepicasso.github.io/Rain-of-Stages/)
